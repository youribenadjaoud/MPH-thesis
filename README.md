# MPH Thesis Project
This repository holds all necessary code for Youri Benadjaoud's MPH Thesis at Brown University School of Public Health

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need Python 3.9.10

In Python, we use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our dependencies. 
To install these dependency managers, you can run (assumes Mac or Linux; see tools' documentation for other operating systems):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3 -
```

Once these are installed, you can install all dependencies with

```bash
poetry install
```
